# PERMADEATH LAUNCHER

**A launcher for Minecraft PERMADEATH servers, built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Tauri 2.0](https://tauri.app/).**

This project is a modern, highly customizable launcher for SMP servers with permanent death mechanics. Its modular architecture leverages Rust for the backend and Tauri for OS integration and the web frontend (HTML, CSS, TypeScript).

## üöÄ Features

- **Modern, responsive interface:** All main panels implemented in the frontend.
- **Full integration with the Minecraft ecosystem:** Includes Microsoft authentication, mod support, backups, and version control.
- **Modular architecture:** Each part fulfills a separate function and is easily integrable into other Rust projects.
